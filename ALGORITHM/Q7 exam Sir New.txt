2. Define the frequency vector w as a range from 0 to pi with 501 points.
 The division by 500 scales the range to [0, pi].
3. Calculate the frequency response H(w) by evaluating the transfer function at each frequency point
. The expression exp(1i*w) represents e^(jw).
4. Calculate the magnitude response magH by taking the absolute value of H.
5. Calculate the phase response angH by taking the angle of H.
6. Create a subplot with 2 rows and 1 column.
7. In the first subplot (top subplot), plot the magnitude response magH versus w/pi. The grid is enabled.
8. Set the title of the subplot as 'Magnitude Response', x-axis label as 
'Frequency in pi units', and y-axis label as 'Magnitude |H|'.
9. In the second subplot (bottom subplot), plot the phase response angH/pi versus w/pi. The grid is enabled.
10. Set the title of the subplot as 'Phase Response', x-axis label as 
'Frequency in pi units', and y-axis label as 'Phase in pi radians'.
