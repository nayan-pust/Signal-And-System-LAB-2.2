The code you provided calculates and plots the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) of a given input signal using the formula:

x(n) = (1/N) * Î£ [X(k) * exp((1i*2*pi*k*n)/N)], for n = 0 to N-1

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. Clear the command window, clear all variables from the workspace, and close all figures.
2. Define the input signal x as [4 0 0 0]. This represents a discrete frequency-domain signal with non-zero value at k=0 and zero values for k=1,2,3.
3. Set the size of the DFT, N, as 4, since the input signal has 4 points.
4. Create a subplot with 2 rows and 1 column.
5. In the first subplot (top subplot), plot the input signal x versus k. The grid is enabled.
6. Set the title of the subplot as 'Input Signal', x-axis label as 'k', and y-axis label as 'x(k)'.
7. Perform the IDFT computation by iterating over each value of n from 0 to N-1. For each value of n, iterate over each value of k from 0 to N-1 and calculate the sum term in the IDFT formula.
8. Store the IDFT values in the vector m.
9. Display the IDFT values in the command window using the disp() function.
10. In the second subplot (bottom subplot), plot the IDFT values m versus n. The grid is enabled.
11. Set the title of the subplot as 'IDFT Values', x-axis label as 'n', and y-axis label as 'x(n)'.

The code calculates the IDFT of the input signal and provides the resulting time-domain signal. The input signal x represents the discrete frequency-domain values, and the IDFT converts it back to the time-domain signal x(n) for n = 0 to N-1.
