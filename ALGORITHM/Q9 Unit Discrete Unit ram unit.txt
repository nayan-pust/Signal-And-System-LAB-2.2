
1. Clear the command window, clear all variables from the workspace, and close all figures.
2. Define the time range `t` as an array from -10 to 10 with a step size of 1.
3. Create a logical array `unitstep` where each element is true (`1`) if the corresponding element in `t` is greater than or equal to 0 and false (`0`) otherwise.
4. Create a logical array `unitsample` where each element is true (`1`) if the corresponding element in `t` is equal to 0 and false (`0`) otherwise.
5. Create the array `unitramp` by element-wise multiplication of `t` and `unitstep`.
6. Create the first subplot with a grid for the plot of the unit step signal using `stem(t, unitstep)`.
7. Set the x-axis label as 'Time', y-axis label as 'Amplitude', and title as 'Unit Step Discrete Time'.
8. Enable the grid for the first subplot.
9. Create the second subplot with a grid for the plot of the unit sample signal using `stem(t, unitsample)`.
10. Set the x-axis label as 'Time', y-axis label as 'Amplitude', and title as 'Unit Sample Discrete Time'.
11. Enable the grid for the second subplot.
12. Create the third subplot with a grid for the plot of the unit ramp signal using `stem(t, unitramp)`.
13. Set the x-axis label as 'Time', y-axis label as 'Amplitude', and title as 'Unit Ramp Discrete Time'.
14. Enable the grid for the third subplot.
15. End of the code.
